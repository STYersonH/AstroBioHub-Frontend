      <h1>üöÄ Mice in Space: The Adventure of the Bion-M 1 Mission</h1>

      <div class="resumen">
        <p>
          Have you ever wondered what happens to our bodies in space? To find
          out, scientists sent a group of brave mice on a
          <span class="highlight">30-day</span> space mission aboard the Bion-M
          1 satellite. This is the story of their journey and what we learned
          thanks to them.
        </p>
      </div>

        />
      </div>

      <h2>üéØ What Was the Mission's Goal?</h2>
      <p>
        After a 16-year hiatus, Russia launched the Bion-M 1 satellite in 2013.
        The main goal was to study how the lack of gravity (<span class="badge"
          >microgravity</span
        >) affects the body at a cellular and molecular level. Scientists wanted
        to see the changes in the <span class="badge">muscles</span>,
        <span class="badge">bones</span>, <span class="badge">heart</span>,
        <span class="badge">blood vessels</span>, and the
        <span class="badge">nervous system</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>üê≠ Preparing the "Astro-Mice"</h2>
      <p>
        Not just any mouse could go to space. Male mice of the C57/BL6 strain
        were selected. The biggest challenge was that male mice tend to fight,
        so they had to undergo special training:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coexistence:</strong> Groups of three mice were formed and
          learned to <span class="highlight">live together peacefully</span> in
          small spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special Diet:</strong> They were trained to eat a special food
          with a <span class="highlight">paste-like texture</span> that provided
          all the nutrients and water they needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final Selection:</strong> Only the healthiest, calmest, and
          most adaptable mice were chosen for the journey.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üõ∞Ô∏è Life Aboard the Satellite</h2>
      <p>
        The mice lived in automated cylindrical habitats. One of the most
        interesting observations was seeing how their behavior changed: on
        Earth, they moved around on the habitat floor. In space, without
        gravity, they were constantly seen
        <span class="highlight">clinging to the feeder wall</span>, looking for
        a foothold.
      </p>

      <h2>üåç The Return to Earth and the Results</h2>
      <p>
        After 30 days in orbit, the capsule with the mice landed in the steppes
        of Kazakhstan. Upon their return, the animals showed clear signs of
        being unadapted to gravity: they were <span class="badge">weak</span>,
        <span class="badge">disoriented</span>, and had difficulty standing and
        walking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, not all the mice survived due to a failure in the feeding
        system. However, scientists noticed something very positive:
        <span class="highlight">there were no fights among them</span>. The
        coexistence training had worked perfectly!
      </p>

      <h2>üî¨ What Did We Learn from this Mission?</h2>
      <p>
        Despite the technical issues, the Bion-M 1 mission was a success. The
        returning mice provided valuable data on how life in space causes
        <span class="highlight"
          >muscle atrophy, bone weakness, and balance problems</span
        >. This information is crucial for protecting the health of astronauts
        on future long-duration missions, like a trip to Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary, these little "astro-mice" made a great sacrifice that helps
        us better understand the challenges of space exploration and prepare for
        the future.
