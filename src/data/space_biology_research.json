Due to microgravity, bones no longer support the habitual loads they support on Earth, which discourages bone formation and increases resorption. Observational and experimental studies estimate an average decrease of between 1% and 2% of bone mineral density (BMD) per month in load-bearing bones, such as the lumbar region, pelvis, and femur. This loss puts skeletal integrity, impact resistance at risk, and may increase the risk of fractures both during the mission and after returning to Earth."

Additionally, factors such as space radiation, changes in calcium metabolism, and nutritional deficiencies contribute to skeletal deterioration. Although some countermeasures (resistance exercise, supplements, antiresorptive drugs) have shown encouraging effects, no intervention has managed to completely stop bone loss in all subjects."
